# Nightly builds

Nightly builds are potentially unstable builds of the tool, containing features that are still works in progress. 

That being said, please remember to backup your work, in case there are bugs that might compromise your work. I strongly recommending how to use Git version control to backup your work if you're able to figure it out, as it can make it a lot easier to track changes to mods you're working on.

They are also used for open beta testing, to get early community feedback to help make the tool better.

It is intended to only ever have the latest version of nightlies published here at a time. This is to encourage usage of the latest versions that would also have all the latest features and bug fixes. i.e. Don't be surprised if you see files disappearing 🙂

# 每夜构建（Nightly Builds）

每夜构建是该工具的潜在不稳定版本，其中包含仍在开发中的功能。

因此，请务必提前备份你的工作，以防存在可能损坏数据或成果的错误。如果你能够上手，我强烈建议使用 Git 版本控制来备份你的工作，它可以让你更轻松地追踪正在制作的模组所发生的更改。

这些构建版本也用于开放测试（Open Beta），以便尽早收集社区反馈，从而帮助改进工具。

这里始终只会发布最新的每夜构建版本。这样做是为了鼓励大家使用包含最新功能和错误修复的版本。
也就是说——如果你发现文件突然消失了，请不要感到惊讶 🙂
