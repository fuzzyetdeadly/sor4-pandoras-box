**Pandora's box** is a powerful modding tool that allows you to directly modify data configurations **Streets of Rage 4** (SOR4) via its **bigfile**.

The *bigfile* contains configurations that control the majority of the behaviors in the game.

It is being used for modding projects like [**SOR4: Reignited**](https://gamebanana.com/mods/473047) (by the **SoulFire team**) and **SOR4: Turbo** (by Bragdras).

The games [data structures](./technical/data-structures.md) are very complex; Thus, _Pandora's box_ is designed to have minimal "training wheels" to maximize modding flexibility to the user. There **WILL** be a learning curve, so be sure to pace yourself with learning about the nuances of modding this game so you don't burn out.

*Pandora's box* was created from scratch after reverse engineering the [SOR4 Swapper](https://gamebanana.com/tools/7320) and [SOR4Explorer](https://gamebanana.com/tools/7297). A special thanks to the authors of these amazing tools, which allowed this to be created!

## About the creators

### FuzzYetDeadly

I started playing SOR4 during the pandemic, and I got pretty hooked. I mostly did score-running in v7 of the game back then, and have achieved most of my goals already. Since then, my passion has shifted towards making mods for the game, and enabling others to do the same.

Thus, the idea for *Pandora's box* was born. Work began in mid 2023, and will be ongoing at a pace that is reasonable for the creators. There are many more features I would still like to add to the tool, but I foresee it's going to take a long time.

## Maintainer's notes

To manage expectations a bit, I don't have a lot of free time on my hands to *update the contents of this document* and *release updates to the tool*. I will likely be doing these on a best effort basis. Don't be surprised if it might be months to years between updates.

If there is some content you seek but cannot find, you may also join other modders at the _SoulFire Team's_ [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UzrMtCD7y9) (a discussion hub for *Pandora's box* as well). This would also be a good place to engage other modders and aid one another with the data discovery process (we don't know everything about the *bigfile*, it's very complex.)

Do say "Hi" after you join so I know you're not a bot, then I will assign you a role so you can see the channels in the server.
