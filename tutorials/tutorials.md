# Tutorials

Tutorials are intended to be **community driven**, as it is too much work for the maintainer of this repository to do it all alone. Instructions on how to contribute can be found [here](#how-can-i-contribute).

The categorization and layout of the contents here is expected to evolve as more content gets added.

## How can I contribute?

If you wish to contribute a tutorial, submissions of pull requests are very welcome. Here are the steps. (If you're not sure about any of these, please ask Google or ChatGPT)

1\. Use a **Git client** to clone this repository, then create a branch like `tutorial\change-move-damage` before you begin writing

2\. Open the project with a program like **Visual studio code** (recommended), and install the plugin **Markdown all in one**. The document should be written with Markdown formatting

3\. Add an bulleted tutorial entry above under a header that makes sense, then link it to your page. e.g.

```markdown
## Characters

* [My tutorial](./change-move-damage.md)
```

4\. Write the content for your page

5\. Finally, create a pull request to this repository, with your tutorial page targeting the `main` branch. A maintainer will review the page when capacity allows, and may provide feedback to request improvements.

Please read the [guidelines](#contribution-guidelines) before you begin, thanks.

## Contribution guidelines

Mind that to ensure this document is maintained in quality, submissions will need to pass a peer review before they are accepted. Below are some guidelines to consider when creating content for contributed pages.

### Do

* Check if a page with similar content already exists.  
There may be opportunities to enhance existing pages to have improved readability.
* Tell the reader what your page attempts to answer
* Proof read your work to ensure the question is answered
* Use images to boost the clarity of what you are describing in your content  
![Info:](../assets/images/icons/icon_info.png) These can be placed in the `./assets/images/tutorials` folder
* **\[Optionally\]** Use videos to describe your solution
* **\[Optionally\]** Make references to [data structures](../technical/data-structures.md) to describe your solution where relevant.

### Don't

* Attempt to generate low-effort content from this page with AI. 
The subject matter is very niche, and I do not expect AI to have the deep knowledge to write well about it.
Feel free to use it to proof read/generate text with proper prompts, but do review/edit the result to ensure it reads smoothly to readers.
* Make any content submissions that might be offensive to readers. This includes but isn't limited to anything political, religious, and cultural in nature. Keep it civil, thanks.
